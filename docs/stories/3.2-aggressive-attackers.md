## User Story
**As a player,**  
I want enemy ships to **actively chase and fire at me**  
So that combat feels intense and reactive.  

## Acceptance Criteria

### Engagement Behavior

- Enemies pursue player aggressively even if player tries to escape
- Attackers attempt to maintain optimal attack distance
- Enemies try to position themselves behind the player

### Combat Tactics
- Fire laser bursts at the player when in range
- Adjust movement to avoid simple attacks
- Multiple attackers coordinate to attack from different angles
- Retreat temporarily if taking heavy damage

## Technical Implementation Notes

- Create combat behavior state machine with states:
  - Pursue
  - Attack
  - Evade

- Design weapon systems for enemy ships
- Implement target leading for accurate firing
- Add threat assessment to coordinate multiple attackers

## Definition of Done
