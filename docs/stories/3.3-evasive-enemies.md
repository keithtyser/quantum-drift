# Story: Evasive Enemies

## User Story
**As a player,**  
I want enemies to **dodge my attacks**  
So that combat feels more skill-based and dynamic.  

## Acceptance Criteria

### Evasive Maneuvers
- When targeted, enemies **swerve left/right** unpredictably
- If locked-on by a missile, they execute an **emergency roll** or sharp turn
- Smaller, agile enemy types are more evasive than larger ships
- Enemies use boost/afterburners to quickly escape dangerous situations

### Detection & Response
- Enemies can detect when they're being targeted by player
- Enemies can detect incoming missiles and attempt evasion
- Response time varies by enemy type/difficulty
- Visual indicators show when an enemy is performing evasive maneuvers

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Implement threat detection system for enemies
- Create evasive maneuver library:
  - Random swerve patterns
  - Emergency rolls
  - Boost escapes
  - Defensive loops
- Add target prediction to determine optimal evasion direction
- Implement cooldown system for special maneuvers
- Balance evasion vs. aggression based on enemy type

## Definition of Done
- Enemies successfully detect when they're targeted
- Enemies perform appropriate evasive maneuvers
- Different enemy types have distinct evasion styles
- Evasion is balanced (not impossible to hit but requires skill)
- Maneuvers look natural and fit the enemy ship type
- Combat feels more challenging and engaging
