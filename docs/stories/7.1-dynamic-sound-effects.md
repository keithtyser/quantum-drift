# Story: Dynamic Sound Effects

## User Story
**As a player,**  
I want each action to have **clear and satisfying sounds**  
So that gameplay feels immersive.  

## Acceptance Criteria

### Sound Categories
- **Ship sounds**: engines, thrusters, boost, braking
- **Weapon sounds**: laser blasts, missile launches, impacts
- **Explosion sounds**: varying by size and intensity
- **UI sounds**: button clicks, alerts, notifications
- **Environmental sounds**: ambient space, nearby objects

### Audio Features
- Positional audio: **hear enemies approaching from behind**
- Volume varies by distance and object size
- **Alarm sounds** when shields are low or missiles locked
- Sound variations prevent repetition fatigue
- Doppler effect for fast-moving objects

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Implement spatial audio system using Three.js audio capabilities
- Create sound manager with:
  - Sound pools for variation
  - Priority system for audio mixing
  - Distance-based attenuation
  - Dynamic filtering based on environment
- Design sound effects with:
  - Consistent aesthetic
  - Clear differentiation between types
  - Appropriate frequency ranges for simultaneous sounds
- Implement audio accessibility options

## Definition of Done

- Sound levels are balanced and mixed properly
- Performance remains stable with many sound sources
- Alarm sounds clearly communicate danger
- Audio enhances gameplay without being distracting
- Sound system handles many simultaneous sources gracefully
