# Story: Endless Survival Mode

## User Story
**As a player,**  
I want to **fight wave after wave of enemies**  
So that I can test my skill and try to set high scores.  

## Acceptance Criteria

### Wave System
- **Waves increase in difficulty** (more enemies, better AI, different types)
- Each wave announces its number and difficulty
- Short breaks between waves for player to recover
- **Every 5 waves**, a **boss appears**

### Progression & Rewards
- Player earns **points** for kills and waves survived
- At certain scores, **new weapons or ships unlock**
- Player's highest wave and score are recorded
- Rewards are given for reaching milestones

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Implement wave management system:
  - Wave definition (enemy types, counts, spawn patterns)
  - Difficulty scaling algorithm
  - Boss wave integration
  - Spawn management
- Create scoring system with:
  - Points for different enemy types
  - Streak/combo bonuses
  - Wave completion bonuses
- Implement unlockable reward system
- Add persistent high score tracking

## Definition of Done

- Score system tracks and displays points accurately
- Bosses appear at designated intervals
- Unlockable rewards are given at appropriate thresholds
- Game difficulty increases in a balanced way
- High scores and achievements are saved between sessions
- UI clearly communicates current wave, score, and upcoming rewards
