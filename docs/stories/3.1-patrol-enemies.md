# Story: Patrol Enemies

## User Story
**As a developer,**  
I want enemies to **follow pre-set patrol routes**  
So that the player encounters movement-based threats in space.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Patrol Behavior
- Enemies follow defined patrol paths or routes
- Patrol routes can be:
  - Linear back-and-forth
  - Circular
  - Complex patterns with multiple points
- Enemies maintain consistent speed during patrol

### Detection & Engagement
- Enemies have a detection radius for player ships
- When player enters detection radius, enemies switch to engagement mode
- If player escapes (leaves engagement radius), enemies return to patrol route
- Visual indicator shows when enemies have detected the player

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Implement path-following AI using waypoints
- Create detection system with configurable radii for:
  - Initial detection
  - Engagement continuation
  - Giving up pursuit
- Design patrol route editor/configuration system
- Implement state machine for patrol/engage/return behaviors
- Add visual indicators for patrol routes (debug mode)

## Definition of Done
- Enemies successfully follow patrol routes
- Enemies detect player when in range
- Enemies engage player when detected
- Enemies return to patrol route when player escapes
- Different patrol patterns can be configured
- Enemy behavior feels natural and predictable

## Dependencies
- Enemy ship models and animations
- Basic AI framework
- Movement system
