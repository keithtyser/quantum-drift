# Story: Optimized Web Performance

## User Story
**As a developer,**  
I want to **optimize assets and rendering**  
So that the game runs smoothly in a browser.  

## Acceptance Criteria

### Performance Targets
- Maintain 60 FPS on mid-range hardware
- Initial load time under 10 seconds
- Minimal frame drops during intense combat
- Graceful degradation on lower-end devices
- Memory usage remains stable during gameplay

### Optimization Techniques
- **Efficient rendering** of distant objects
- **LOD (Level of Detail) scaling** for enemies and debris
- **WebGL optimizations** to maintain high frame rates
- Asset compression and streaming
- Intelligent object pooling for projectiles and effects

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Implement LOD system:
  - High-detail models for close-up view
  - Medium-detail for medium distance
  - Low-poly or billboards for distant objects
- Create performance monitoring tools:
  - FPS counter
  - Memory usage tracking
  - Render time profiling
- Optimize shader complexity based on device capability
- Implement object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects:
  - Projectiles
  - Explosions
  - Debris
- Design asset streaming system for progressive loading

## Definition of Done
- Game maintains target frame rate during normal gameplay
- Heavy combat scenes don't cause significant slowdown
- Loading times are reasonable on average connections
- Lower-end devices can run the game with reduced settings
- Memory usage remains stable without leaks
- Performance monitoring tools provide useful diagnostics
- Asset compression achieves good balance of quality and size

## Dependencies
- Three.js/React Three Fiber setup
- Asset pipeline
- Rendering system
- WebGL knowledge
