# Story: Optimize Performance and Polish

## User Story
**As a developer,**  
I want to **ensure the game runs smoothly and feels polished**  
So that **players have the best possible experience across devices**.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The game maintains a stable 60 FPS on mid-range hardware.
- Visual and audio elements are refined for consistency and appeal.
- Gameplay mechanics (e.g., physics, abilities) are balanced and enjoyable.
- The game is tested on multiple devices and browsers for compatibility.

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Optimize rendering with techniques like level of detail (LOD) and frustum culling.
- Fine-tune visual effects (e.g., particle density) and audio levels for polish.
- Adjust physics parameters and ability effects based on playtesting feedback.
- Profile performance and address bottlenecks (e.g., memory leaks).

## Definition of Done
