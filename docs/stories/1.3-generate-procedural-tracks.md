# Story: Generate Procedural Tracks

## User Story
**As a player,**  
I want the **track to be dynamically generated and extend infinitely**  
So that the **racing experience is continuous and varied**.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A track generator utility creates procedurally generated track segments.
- New segments spawn ahead of the player as they progress.
- Old segments are removed behind the player to maintain performance.
- The track includes variations (e.g., curves, elevation) for visual and gameplay interest.

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Develop a function to generate track segments using procedural algorithms (e.g., Perlin noise for elevation).
- Manage active segments in the scene, spawning new ones based on the player's position and removing distant ones.
- Optimize rendering by limiting the number of active segments (e.g., 5-10 segments at a time).
- Add basic variation to segment shapes or heights to enhance gameplay.

## Definition of Done
- The track extends infinitely as the player moves forward.
- Segment generation is seamless with no noticeable lag or pop-in.
- Old segments are removed efficiently to prevent performance degradation.
- The track features some variation to keep the experience engaging.
