# Story: Set Up Basic Game Structure

## User Story
**As a developer,**  
I want to **set up the foundational 3D game scene with a camera, lighting, and a simple track**  
So that I can **build the rest of the game upon this base**.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A 3D rendering context is established using React Three Fiber.
- The scene includes ambient and directional lighting for basic illumination.
- A default perspective camera is configured and positioned to view the track.
- A simple flat plane is added as the initial track.
- The scene renders correctly when the development server is started.

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Use React Three Fiber to initialize a 3D canvas within the main app component.
- Add ambient light for overall illumination and a directional light to simulate a sun-like source.
- Configure a perspective camera with appropriate field of view and position it above and behind the track.
- Create a plane geometry with a basic material (e.g., a grid texture) to serve as the initial track.
- Ensure the scene is integrated into the React app and renders without errors.

## Definition of Done
- The game scene component is created and renders within the app.
- Lighting provides clear visibility of the track.
- The camera is positioned to offer a good initial view of the scene.
- A simple track is visible and rendered correctly.
- The development server runs without errors and displays the 3D scene.

## Dependencies
- None (this is the foundational step).
