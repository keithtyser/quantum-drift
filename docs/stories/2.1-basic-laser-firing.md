# Story: Basic Laser Firing

## User Story
**As a player,**  
I want to **fire energy lasers at enemies**  
So that I can damage and destroy them in space combat.  

## Acceptance Criteria

### Weapons System
- Left Mouse Button fires **rapid laser shots**
- Lasers **overheat** if fired continuously for too long
- Visual indicator shows current heat level of weapons
- Cooling period required if weapon overheats completely

### Visual and Audio
- **Visuals**: Bright energy bolts with subtle glow and trail effect
- **Sound FX**: Distinct firing sound + impact sound when hitting an enemy
- Muzzle flash effect at ship weapon hardpoints
- Hit effects on enemy ships (sparks, shield ripple)

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Implement raycast-based weapon system for hitscan lasers
- Create heat management system with variables for:
  - Heat generation per shot
  - Cooling rate
  - Maximum heat capacity
- Design particle effects for laser bolts and impacts
- Implement audio manager for weapon sounds with spatial audio

## Definition of Done
- Player can fire lasers with left mouse button
- Weapon overheats if used excessively
- Heat gauge is visible and readable in the HUD
- Visual and audio feedback makes shooting feel impactful
- Hit detection works correctly with enemies
- Damage system deducts health from hit targets

## Dependencies
- Basic ship movement (Story 1.1)
- Enemy entities implementation
- Particle system
- Audio system
