# Story: Advanced Flight Maneuvers

## User Story
**As a player,**  
I want to **perform evasive maneuvers** (barrel rolls, sudden brakes, quick turns)  
So that I can dodge enemy fire and outmaneuver opponents.  

## Acceptance Criteria

### Maneuvers
- **Barrel Roll** → Press **Q or E** to quickly spin the ship, providing temporary invulnerability
- **Quick Turn** → Press a directional key and a movement key together to execute a sharp turn
- **Drift Mode** → Let go of thrust and manually rotate while drifting for advanced positioning

### Behavior
- Barrel rolls should complete a full 360° rotation in under 1 second
- Quick turns should rapidly change ship orientation while maintaining some momentum
- Drift mode should allow the ship to continue on its trajectory while the player can reorient

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Implement special maneuver state machine with cooldowns
- Add visual effects for each maneuver (motion blur, trail effects)
- Create temporary invulnerability frames during barrel roll
- Implement easing functions for smooth maneuver animations
- Add audio cues for maneuver activation

## Definition of Done
- All three special maneuvers can be triggered and performed
- Maneuvers provide tactical advantages in combat
- Animations are smooth and convey the sense of movement
- Visual effects clearly indicate when a maneuver is being performed
- Cooldown system prevents maneuver spamming

## Dependencies
- Basic ship movement (Story 1.1)
- Animation system
- VFX framework
