# Story: Add Collectible Quantum Particles

## User Story
**As a player,**  
I want to **collect quantum particles to unlock special abilities**  
So that **gameplay is enhanced with strategic options**.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Quantum particles spawn on the track and can be collected by driving through them.
- Collecting particles increases an ability meter visible to the player.
- When the meter is full, a special ability (e.g., speed boost) can be activated.
- Visual and audio feedback accompanies particle collection and ability use.

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Create a particle component with collision detection for collection by the vehicle.
- Implement a spawning system to place particles along the track procedurally.
- Manage an ability meter in the game state, triggering abilities when full.
- Add visual (e.g., particle burst) and audio (e.g., chime) cues for feedback.

## Definition of Done
- Players can collect particles, and the ability meter updates accordingly.
- A special ability activates when the meter is full, affecting gameplay.
- Feedback clearly indicates when particles are collected and abilities are used.
