# Story: Add UI and HUD Elements

## User Story
**As a player,**  
I want a **clear and informative HUD displaying essential game information**  
So that I can **track my speed, abilities, and dimension**.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A HUD displays real-time data: vehicle speed, ability meter, and current dimension.
- The HUD is styled clearly and does not obstruct the gameplay view.
- The UI is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Use TailwindCSS to style HUD elements overlaid on the 3D canvas.
- Share game state (e.g., speed, meter) with the HUD component for live updates.
- Position the HUD in screen corners or edges to avoid blocking the track view.

## Definition of Done
- The HUD shows accurate, up-to-date game information.
- The UI is visually appealing and readable across devices.
- The HUD enhances gameplay without interfering with the playerâ€™s view.
