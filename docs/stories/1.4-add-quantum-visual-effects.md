# Story: Add Quantum Visual Effects

## User Story
**As a player,**  
I want to **see quantum-inspired visual effects like particle systems**  
So that the **gameâ€™s theme is enhanced and immersion is increased**.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A particle system is implemented to represent quantum effects (e.g., glowing particles).
- Particle effects are tied to the vehicle or track (e.g., trailing behind the vehicle).
- The effects are optimized to maintain smooth performance.

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Create a particle system component using Three.js or React Three Fiber utilities.
- Position particles relative to the vehicle (e.g., as an exhaust trail) or along the track.
- Use efficient rendering techniques (e.g., instanced meshes) to prevent frame rate drops.
- Design particles with a quantum aesthetic (e.g., shimmering, uncertain motion).

## Definition of Done
- Quantum-inspired particle effects are visible during gameplay.
- The effects enhance the visual theme without overwhelming the scene.
- Performance remains stable with the particle system active.
