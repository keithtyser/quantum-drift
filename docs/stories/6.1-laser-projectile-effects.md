# Story: Laser and Projectile Effects

## User Story
**As a player,**  
I want to **see bright, glowing projectiles with impact effects**  
So that combat feels visually exciting.  

## Acceptance Criteria

### Projectile Visuals
- Laser shots glow with slight trail effects
- Different weapon types have distinct visual styles:
  - Standard lasers: bright, thin beams
  - Charge lasers: thick, pulsing energy beams
  - Spread shots: multiple thin lasers
  - Missiles: solid projectiles with exhaust trails
- Projectiles illuminate surrounding objects while in flight

### Impact Effects
- Hits produce **small explosions or shield ripples**
- Different surfaces react differently to impacts:
  - Shields show energy ripples
  - Hull surfaces show sparks and smoke
  - Explosions when hitting critical components
- Impact effects scale with weapon power

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Implement shader-based glow effects for energy weapons
- Create particle systems for:
  - Weapon trails
  - Impact sparks
  - Shield ripples
  - Explosions
- Use point lights for dynamic illumination from projectiles
- Design impact effect manager that varies based on:
  - Surface type
  - Weapon type
  - Impact angle
- Optimize effects for performance in heavy combat

## Definition of Done
- All projectile types have distinctive and attractive visual effects
- Impact effects vary based on surface type
- Effects enhance combat feedback without obscuring gameplay
- Visual effects are consistent with weapon power and type
- Performance remains stable even with many effects on screen
- Effects properly highlight hits and misses

## Dependencies
- Basic laser firing (Story 2.1)
- Missile system (Story 2.2)
- Three.js shader system
- Particle system
