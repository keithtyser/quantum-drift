# Story: Implement Multiple Racing Dimensions

## User Story
**As a player,**  
I want to **race through different dimensions with unique physics and visuals**  
So that the **game offers variety and challenge**.

## Acceptance Criteria
- At least two dimensions are implemented, each with distinct physics (e.g., gravity, friction) and visual styles.
- Transitions between dimensions occur via specific triggers (e.g., portals or collectibles).
- The current dimension is clearly indicated to the player (e.g., via color changes).
- Physics and visuals update seamlessly during dimension switches.

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Define dimension properties (e.g., low gravity, high friction) and store the current dimension in game state.
- Create transition triggers (e.g., portal objects) to switch dimensions.
- Apply visual changes (e.g., shaders, color filters) and adjust physics settings per dimension.
- Ensure smooth transitions with no performance hitches.

## Definition of Done
- The game features multiple distinct dimensions.
- Players can transition between dimensions during gameplay.
- Each dimension offers a unique experience in physics and visuals.
- Transitions are fluid and maintain gameplay continuity.
