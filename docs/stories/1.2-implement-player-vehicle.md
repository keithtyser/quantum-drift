# Story: Implement Player Vehicle

## User Story
**As a player,**  
I want to **control a vehicle on the track**  
So that I can **start experiencing the racing gameplay**.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A vehicle component is added to the 3D scene.
- The vehicle is physics-enabled using React Three Rapier.
- Keyboard controls are implemented for movement (forward, backward, left, right).
- The vehicle moves realistically on the track in response to player inputs.

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Create a vehicle component with a 3D model (e.g., a simple car mesh) and a rigid body using React Three Rapier.
- Implement keyboard input handling to apply forces (e.g., thrust) and torques (e.g., steering) to the vehicle.
- Adjust physics properties such as mass, friction, and damping for natural movement behavior.
- Ensure the vehicle interacts correctly with the track surface.

## Definition of Done
- The vehicle is controllable via keyboard inputs (e.g., W/A/S/D or arrow keys).
- Movement feels responsive and follows basic physics rules.
- The vehicle remains on the track without clipping through it.
- The implementation integrates seamlessly with the existing scene.
