# Story: Basic Ship Movement

## User Story
**As a player,**  
I want to **freely control my spaceship in all directions** (yaw, pitch, roll, strafe, throttle)  
So that I can navigate space in a natural and responsive way.  

## Acceptance Criteria

### Controls
- **W/S** → Increase/Decrease thrust
- **A/D** → Strafe left/right
- **Mouse movement** → Pitch and yaw rotation
- **Q/E** → Roll left/right
- **Space** → Boost forward (short burst)
- **Shift** → Brake

### Movement Behaviors
- Movement should be **inertia-based** (conserving momentum) but with a slight auto-stabilization to prevent infinite drifting
- Thrust accelerates gradually, while braking slows the ship quickly
- Camera smoothly follows behind the ship with slight lag for a cinematic feel

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Implement physics-based movement using Three.js/React Three Fiber
- Create ship controller class that handles input and translates to movement
- Add damping coefficient for auto-stabilization
- Implement camera follow logic with smooth transitions
- Add visual feedback for thrust (engine glow/particles)

## Definition of Done
- Player can control the ship in all 6 degrees of freedom
- Movement feels smooth and responsive
- Inertia is preserved while still being controllable
- Camera follows ship appropriately without causing motion sickness
- HUD displays current speed and direction

## Dependencies
- Ship 3D model assets
- Basic space environment setup
- Input handling system
