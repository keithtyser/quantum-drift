# User Story: Weapon Muzzle Flash and Sound Effects

## Description
As a player, I want to see muzzle flashes and hear sound effects when firing weapons to enhance the immersive experience of space combat.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Bright muzzle flash effect appears at weapon hardpoints when firing
- [x] Flash illuminates surrounding area with dynamic lighting
- [x] Particle effects for energy discharge are visible
- [x] Laser sound effects play synchronously with firing
- [x] Sound effects use spatial audio for better immersion
- [x] Volume adjusts based on distance and perspective
- [x] Different sound variations play to prevent repetition
- [x] Visual feedback is clear when weapons are fired
- [x] Effects are optimized for performance with instanced rendering
- [x] Resources are properly cleaned up to prevent memory leaks
- [x] Boost sound effect plays when the boost key is pressed
- [x] Damage sound effect plays when the player takes damage
- [x] Explosion sound effect plays when player or enemies are destroyed

## Technical Implementation Details

### Components
1. **MuzzleFlash Component**
   - Create a new component for rendering muzzle flash effects
   - Integrate with the existing WeaponSystem component
   - Use Three.js PointLight for dynamic lighting
   - Implement particle effects for energy discharge

2. **Sound Integration**
   - Use the existing SoundControl utility for playing laser sounds
   - Implement spatial audio for better immersion
   - Add randomization to prevent repetitive sounds
   - Ensure proper cleanup of audio resources
   - Add boost sound effect with cooldown to prevent sound spam
   - Add damage and explosion sound effects
   - Implement volume randomization for more natural sound variation

### Implementation Steps
1. Create MuzzleFlash component with visual effects
2. Add dynamic lighting to illuminate surrounding area
3. Implement particle effects for energy discharge
4. Integrate sound effects with the WeaponSystem
5. Add spatial audio and volume adjustment
6. Implement sound variations to prevent repetition
7. Add boost sound effect with cooldown mechanism
8. Add damage and explosion sound effects
9. Optimize for performance
10. Ensure proper cleanup of resources

## Dependencies
- WeaponSystem component
- SoundControl utility
- Three.js PointLight
- Particle system
- Sound files: laser.aac, boost.aac, damage.aac, explosion.aac

## Notes
- Muzzle flash should be visible but not overwhelming
- Sound effects should be satisfying but not annoying when firing rapidly
- Performance is critical as these effects will be triggered frequently
- Consider using instanced rendering for particle effects
- Ensure proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Implement cooldown for boost sound to prevent sound spam
- Use volume randomization for more natural sound variation
