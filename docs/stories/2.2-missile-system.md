# Story: Missile System

## User Story
**As a player,**  
I want to **lock on to enemies and fire homing missiles**  
So that I can take down distant or fast-moving enemies.  

## Acceptance Criteria

### Targeting & Firing
- Right Mouse Button **locks onto an enemy** in crosshair
- Visual and audio feedback confirms lock-on
- Once locked, pressing **R Key** fires missile
- Limited missile ammo with HUD counter
- Cooldown period between missile launches

### Missile Behavior
- Missiles follow targets but can be dodged with sharp maneuvers
- Explosion on impact with **area-of-effect damage**
- Missiles have limited fuel/range
- Missile speed allows skilled players to evade

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Implement target selection and locking system
- Create missile entity with:
  - Guidance system (PID controller or similar)
  - Fuel/lifespan limitation
  - Proximity detonation
  - Collision detection
- Design missile exhaust particle effects
- Implement explosion effect and area damage calculation
- Add missile inventory and cooldown management

## Definition of Done
- Player can lock onto targets and fire missiles
- Missiles track their targets effectively but not perfectly
- Visual indicator shows lock-on status and target
- Missile ammo count is displayed and decremented correctly
- Explosions affect multiple targets in blast radius
- Audio cues provide feedback for lock-on, launch, and detonation

## Dependencies
- Basic ship movement (Story 1.1)
- Basic laser firing (Story 2.1)
- Enemy entities implementation
- Particle system
- Audio system
