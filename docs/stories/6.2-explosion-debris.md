# Story: Explosion and Debris

## User Story
**As a player,**  
I want enemies to **explode in a satisfying way**  
So that combat has weight and impact.  

## Acceptance Criteria

### Explosion Effects
- When an enemy is destroyed:
  - Initial bright flash at the center
  - **Explosion effect** with expanding fireball
  - Secondary smaller explosions
  - Shockwave ripple effect
- Explosions scale with size of the destroyed enemy
- Boss explosions are particularly spectacular and multi-staged

### Debris System
- **Debris scatters in space** following physics:
  - Hull fragments
  - Mechanical parts
  - Sparking electronics
- Debris continues on trajectory influenced by explosion force
- Debris gradually fades away or disintegrates
- Debris can collide with other objects

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Create layered explosion effect system:
  - Core flash (sprite/mesh)
  - Expanding fireball (particle system)
  - Smoke and fire trails (particle system)
  - Shockwave (shader effect)
- Implement debris generation:
  - Procedural mesh fragmentation
  - Pre-designed debris pieces
  - Physics simulation for movement
- Add sound design integration:
  - Primary explosion sound
  - Secondary explosion sounds
  - Debris sounds
- Optimize with LOD system for distant explosions

## Definition of Done
- Explosions look impactful and satisfying
- Different enemy types have appropriate explosion scales
- Debris behaves physically realistically
- Performance remains stable even with large explosions
- Explosions provide clear feedback on enemy destruction
- Sound and visual effects are synchronized
- Boss explosions feel appropriately climactic

## Dependencies
- Laser and projectile effects (Story 6.1)
- Enemy entities
- Physics system
- Particle system
- Sound system
