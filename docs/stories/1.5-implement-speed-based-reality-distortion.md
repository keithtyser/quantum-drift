# Story: Implement Speed-Based Reality Distortion

## User Story
**As a player,**  
I want the **environment to distort based on my speed**  
So that I can **experience a quantum-inspired reality warping effect**.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Time dilation effect: environmental animations (e.g., particle motion) slow as speed increases.
- Space warping effect: visual distortion of the track and surroundings at high speeds (e.g., stretching).
- Effects are applied smoothly and enhance immersion without causing discomfort.

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Calculate vehicle speed and use it to adjust animation time scales for environmental objects.
- Apply a shader to the camera or track to simulate space warping (e.g., field of view changes or distortion effects).
- Implement gradual transitions for both effects to avoid jarring visuals.

## Definition of Done
- The environment visibly changes as the vehicle accelerates.
- Time dilation and space warping effects align with the quantum theme.
- The effects are comfortable to view and do not induce motion sickness.
