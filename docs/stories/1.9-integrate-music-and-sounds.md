# Story: Integrate Music and Sounds

## User Story
**As a player,**  
I want **immersive sound effects and music that respond to my actions**  
So that the **overall experience is enhanced**.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Sound effects play for key actions (e.g., engine hum, particle collection, ability activation).
- Background music adapts to the current dimension or speed.
- Audio is synchronized with gameplay events and balanced for immersion.

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Use Tone.js to manage sound effects and dynamic music tracks.
- Trigger sounds based on player actions (e.g., engine pitch increases with speed).
- Implement music layering or transitions tied to game state (e.g., dimension shifts).
- Apply spatial audio for effects where appropriate.

## Definition of Done
- Sound effects enhance gameplay actions effectively.
- Music adapts to the game state, enriching the atmosphere.
- Audio is well-balanced and performs without issues.
